            <p class="text">Passionate web developer currently living in Spain. 
                Learning german is my other passion, hence the name of this project. 
                'Der Weg' means 'The Way' in german, symbolizing that I'm on a path to becomimg 
                a better developer.</br>
                Before getting fully immersed in the world of tech, I studied for 12 years 
                in Argentina to become a doctor first, and then an anesthesiologist. 
                I thoroughly enjoyed that part of my life, but I knew I wanted something else.
                As a very analytical person I take pleasure in solving problems, 
                a fundamental part of being an anesthesiologist, but more often than not
                the creativity required to perform the job was limited.</br>
                Through coding I was able to combine both aspects, creating things 
                by solving problems. So I decided to pursue this career to 
                unleash my full potential. So far it has been challenging, but it has also 
                been very rewarding. </br>
                As I was learning to develop websites I discovered Ruby and Ruby on Rails 
                and fell in love with them. I hope I can keep growing as a developer and
                learning plenty of tools to outdo myself.
            </p>
