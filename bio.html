        <p id="bio1" class="bio">Web developer currently living in Spain. 
            Learning german is my other passion, hence the name of this project. 
            'Der Weg' means 'The Way', symbolizing not only that I'm on a path to become a better developer,
            but also my journey towards the kind of life I aim to achieve.</br>
            Prior to getting fully immersed in the world of tech I studied 12 years in Argentina to become a doctor first,
            and then an anesthesiologist. I throughly enjoyed that part of my life, but I knew I wanted something else.
            As a very analytical person I take pleasure in solving problems, but as an anesthesiologist the creative
            part was missing.</br>
            Through coding I was able to combine both aspects, creating things by solving problems. So I decided to pursue
            this career in order to unleash my full potential. So far it has been challenging, but it has also been very rewarding.
